# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Steps and Importance

## 🧠 Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**—a crucial step in the data science and machine learning pipeline. It includes structured notebooks and explanations on each EDA component, with examples using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly).

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the importance of EDA in a data project
* Learn to detect patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses
* Prepare the data for further analysis and modeling
* Improve data quality and insight discovery

---

## 🔍 EDA Steps Covered

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**

   * Understand structure, size, and data types
2. **Missing Value Treatment**

   * Detect and handle null or missing data
3. **Univariate Analysis**

   * Frequency, distribution plots for single variables
4. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**

   * Relationships between features and target variable
5. **Outlier Detection & Handling**

   * Identify unusual data points using IQR, Z-score
6. **Data Transformations**

   * Scaling, encoding, binning, log transforms
7. **Feature Engineering**

   * Create meaningful features from raw data
8. **Visualization**

   * Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for storytelling
